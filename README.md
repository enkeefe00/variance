# Introduction
Maintaining configurations for all the sites a customer has can be extremely tedious and can introduce human error when attempting to “copy-paste” changes made in one site’s configurations to another site. Additionally, most site configurations can be categorized into sub-types where each sub-type only differs by a few changes like rated power, site name, and IP addresses. Variance is a way to minimize human error and centralize configuration storage in release branches by storing the templated configurations, customizing them based on site specific data, and then populating the appropriate site/device folder in the current branch of integration_dev with the site specific configs and/or tests. See the [Variance](https://flexgen.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SI/pages/277577729/Variance) confluence page for more information.
